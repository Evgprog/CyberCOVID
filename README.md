 # CyberCovid

 ## Project's aims: 
 
 To allow localizaton of quarantine policy measures on cities based on early identification of covid spread.
 Currently, a more binary policy is being used where all or no cities are quarantied.
 The measures for infectios deseace prevention were used on the number of admitted patients.
 Risk analysis is done on overall number of patients which were identified
 and earlier detection based on the  prediction of possible number off patients might allow a more proactive measure to take place

 The structure of analysis :
 
 # Project's aims:
# Prediction of COVID 19 patients number in Israeli cities.
# DATA SOURCE:
# The data set taken from Israeli Health ministry and was uploaded from :
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idandrd/israel-covid19-data/master/CityData.csv
# Project's value:
# Early identification potential of Covid 19 spread in certain Israeli city.
# Earlier detection should allow a more proactive measures to take place in order to stop the spread of Covid 19
Branch A   
1. Data upload from a website that contains a history of patients dinamycs  per city
2. Data  insertion into a pandas dataframework
3. Cleaning and prepearing of dataframe for analysis
4. Creating several models and classes for linear regression analysis and predictions
5. Creating a trashold for data set on 08 score
6. Applying models for each city dataset


Branch B (with dash)

# Code structure:
# 1. Getting data regarding number of patients by city from github dataset
# 2. Normalizing data, fixing mistakes
# 3. Creating functions for dash, models for dates, regression analysis
# 4. Creating predictions for spreading rate per city
# 5. Display the prediction spread by city chosen by user
