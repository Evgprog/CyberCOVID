# Project's value:
# Early identification potential of Covid 19 spread in certain Israeli city.
# Earlier detection should allow a more proactive measures to take place in order to stop the spread of Covid 19

Branch A (master) 
1. Data upload from a website that contains a history of patient’s dynamics per city
2. Data insertion into a panda’s dataframework
3. Cleaning and preparing of dataframe for analysis
4. Creating several models and classes for linear regression analysis and predictions
5. Creating a Threshhold for data set on 08 score
6. Applying models for each city dataset


Branch B (with dash)

# Code structure:
# 1. Getting data regarding number of patients by city from github dataset
# 2. Normalizing data, fixing mistakes
# 3. Creating functions for dash, models for dates, regression analysis
